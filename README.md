# Zen Browser CSS Tweaks
A CSS file to fix some minor misalignment and spacing issues. Aims to make your Zen Browser experience a bit better while also giving you the option to modify the css and use your own colors. (Default Theme: OLED).
This Theme was created to fix my OCD over these tiny misalignments. ðŸ—¿

**RECOMMENDED THEMES:** Compact Sidebar, Floating URLbar

## How To Install
1. Open Zen Browser.
2. Head to "about:support".
3. Locate "Profile Folder" and hit "Open Folder".
4. Locate the "chrome" folder. If the folder is not there, create it or make sure to download before mentioned recommended themes first.
5. Download the [userChrome.css](./userChrome.css) file and put it inside the "chrome" folder.
6. Restart Zen Browser.
